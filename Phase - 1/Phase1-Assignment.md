Below are few projects that can be tried to deepen your understanding on concepts discussed in Phase 1.We would encourage you to work on these projects.Feel free to choose one or many or any other project that excites you.

1. **Binary/Multiclass Class**

   1. Histopathological Cancer Detection

      https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection

      Evaluation Metric - ROC Curve

   2. Human Protein Atlas Image Classification

      https://www.kaggle.com/c/human-protein-atlas-image-classification

      This dataset is highly Imbalanced.

      Evaluation Metric - Macro F1 score

      

2. **Multi Label**

   Planet -Understanding the Amazon from Space

   https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space/data

   Evaluation Metric :mean (F_{2}) score

   https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.fbeta_score.html

   Beta =2 for higher weightage to recall over precision





**Kernels for Reference**

1. **Binary Class**
